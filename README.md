# Twelve Fake Invisible Catastrophes and Threats of Doom
#### Patrick Moore, PhD – revised January 2019
pmoore@ecosense.me

Some	time ago	it	struck me	that	the	majority	of	alleged	environmental	catastrophes and	threats are	
invisible or	very	remote,	thus	making	it	virtually	impossible	for	the	average	person	to	validate	them	
through	 observation.	 Observations,	 along	 with	 replications of	 those	 observations,	 are	 the	 very	
foundation	of	the	scientific	method.	Seeing	is	*believing*,	and	seeing the	same	result again	and	again	
under	similar	circumstances	 reinforces	 the	belief.	 Is	it	possible	 that	activist	groups and	 the	media
choose	to	cite	supposed	catastrophes	and	threats	that	are	invisible,	very remote or	both because	the	
majority	of	people	cannot	verify	them	in	person	and	therefore	must	rely	on	the	activists,	the	media,	
and	other	third	parties	to	tell	them	the	truth?	At	the	conclusion	of	this	essay,	the	reader	may	judge.	
Here’s a	list	of	some of	the	alleged invisible	catastrophes and	threats	of	doom,	beginning	with	one	of	
the	former.


# Coral reefs around the world are dying
This	is	only	one	of	the	many	supposed	catastrophes	blamed	on invisible human	CO2	emissions	and	
human-caused	 climate	 change.	 In	 April	 2016	most	major	media	 outlets	 ran	 a	 story	 implying	that	
93%	of	the	Great	Barrier	Reef,	the	largest	in	the	world,	was	“dead”,	“nearly	dead”,	or	“dying”.[<sup>1</sup>][1] This	
was	all	based	on	a	report	 that	93%	of	reefs in	 the	northern	section	had	 “some	bleaching”.	“Some”	
could	be	only	1	percent.	And	bleaching	is not	death	or	even	dying.	It	is	a	normal	occurrence	during	
periods of high	heat	and	 the	coral	usually	 recovers.	Of	course,	as	with	all	 species,	 some	are	dying	
and	others	are	being	born at	any	given	time.

It	is	well	known	that	the	world’s	warmest	oceans	are	in	the	region	of	Indonesia,	the	Philippines,	and	
the	Solomon	Islands.	This	area	is	called	the	Coral	Triangle	and	it	harbors	the	world’s	largest	number	
of	coral	species	and	the	largest	number	of	reef	fish	and	other	reef	dwellers.[<sup>2</sup>][2] Surely	this	puts	to	rest
the	assertion	that	the	world’s	seas	are	“too	hot”	for	coral	reefs due	to	climate	change.

How	is	the	average	person	in	Europe	or	
North	 America	 supposed	 to	 “see	 for	
themselves”	 what	 is	 really	 occurring?	
Not	 only	 is	 the	 reef	 thousands	 of	 miles	
away	from	most	people	and	far	offshore,	
it	 is	 below	 the	 surface	 of	 the	 sea.	
Hundreds	 of	 millions	 of	 people	 were	
told	the	reef	was	doomed	when	we	now	
know	 much	 of	 the	 bleached	 coral	 has	
already	 recovered.	 But	 that	 fact	 was	
barely	 reported	in	major	media	 outlets.	
Fake	news	flies,	the	real	story	never	gets	
off	the	ground.

*Bleached	coral	is	not	the	same	as	dead	coral.	This	coral	will	likely	
recover	once	a	hot	spell	ends.*

# Polar bears will become extinct
Again, climate change is the culprit. Melting	
Arctic	ice,	thinner	ice,	and	not	enough	seals	to	eat	
are said to be a threat to the bear’s very	
existence.[<sup>3</sup>][3] How	many	people	can	go	to	the	Arctic	
and	get	a	good	look	at	the	polar	bear	population?	
The truth is the polar bear population has	
increased	from	about	6,000	–	8,000	in	the	1960s	
to	25,000	–	28,000	today.[<sup>4</sup>][4] This	is	due	mainly	to	a	
treaty signed by all the Arctic nations in 1973	
that ended the unregulated hunting of polar	
bears.[<sup>5</sup>][5] There is no real reason to fear for their	
demise. We know polar bears survived the	
last	 interglacial period, the Eemian, 120,000	
years	 ago, which was warmer than the	
current	 Holocene interglacial period. But	
photos of old	 starving	 bears,	 bears	 supposedly	
“trapped”	 on	 ice	 floes, and bears that are	
thin after a long	 hibernation, are	
effectively employed to	 perpetuate the	
myth that they are threatened	with	extinction.

*This	heart-wrenching	image	of	a	polar	bear	dying	of	old	age	
was	used	to	claim	that	polar	bears	are	going	extinct	due	to	
climate	change.*

# Climate catastrophe is inevitable due an increase in atmospheric CO2 if we don’t end the use of fossil fuels
Not	only	is	CO2 invisible,	is	also	odorless	and	 tasteless	so	cannot	be	sensed	without	sophisticated	
equipment.	 Yet	we	 are	 told	it	is	 causing	 a	 catastrophe	 of	 global	 proportions.	 The	 facts	that	 CO2	is	
lower	in	the	atmosphere	today	than	it	has	been	through	nearly	all the	history	of	life	and	that global	
temperature	during	the	ongoing 2.5	million-year	long	Pleistocene	Ice	Age	is	colder	than	it	has	been	
for the	past	250	million	years are	simply	ignored.[<sup>6</sup>][6] Never	mind	the	 fact	that	CO2	is	the	basis	 for all	
life	 on	 Earth.	 CO2 in	 the	 atmosphere	 and	 in	 the	 oceans	 is	 where	 the	 carbon	 in	 carbon-based	 life	
originates.	At	least	some	attention	is	now	given	to	the	fact	that	the	increase	in	our	CO2 emissions	is	
causing	a	greening	of	the	Earth and	the	spreading	of	trees	to	areas	that	were	too	dry	for	them	under	
low-CO2 conditions.	During	the	past	150	million	years	CO2 had	steadily	declined	to	such	a	low	level	
that	plants	were	seriously	threatened	with	starvation during	the	peak	of	the	last	few	glacial	cycles.	
Thankfully,	our	CO2 emissions	have	inadvertently reversed	that	trend,	bringing	some balance	back	
to	the	global	carbon	cycle.	All	of	this	can	be	verified	yet	the	narrative	of	“climate	catastrophe”,	which	
has	no	basis	in	science,	is	hollered	from rooftops	around	the	world.

*CO2 had	been	declining	to	dangerously	low	levels	during	the	past 500	million	years	until	our	CO2	emissions	reversed	the	trend	
and	brought	some	balance	back	to	the	carbon	cycle.[<sup>7</sup>][7] The	uptick	on	the	right	end	of	the	CO2 line	represents	the	contribution	of	
human	emissions.*

# Pesticide residues in our food causes cancer, birth defects, autism, and brain damage

One	 “health	 food”	 website	 claims	 pesticide
residues	 in	 food cause	 nine	 diseases.	 It’s	
unfortunate	that	we	can’t	see,	smell,	or	taste	these	
“residues”.	They	cannot	be	observed	which	makes	
it	easy	to	invent	stories	about	an	“invisible	poison”.

In 1997,	 the	 Cancer	 Research	 Institutes	 of	 the	
United	 States	 and	 Canada	 published	 a	 multi-year	
study	of	all	scientific	publications	reporting	on	any	
connection	 between	 cancer	 in	 humans	 and	
pesticide	 residues	 in	 food.	 They	 did	 not	 find	 a	
single	 piece	 of	 credible	 evidence	 connecting	 the	
two.	 And	 yet	 they	 concluded	 that	 30	 percent	 of	
human	 cancers	 are	 caused	 by	 tobacco	
consumption,	 from	 a	 natural	 plant,	 and	 that	 35%	
of	 cancers	 are	 caused	 by	 poor	 diet,	 mainly	 too	
much	fat	and	cholesterol,	also	natural	substances.<sup>8</sup>

# “Africa’s Oldest Baobab Trees are Dying at an Unprecedented Rate, and Climate Change may be to Blame.”
This	 is	 the	 actual	 headline	 from	 a	 USA	 Today	 article	 on	 June	 11,	 2018.	 Nearly	 every	 major	 news	
outlet	 ran	 with	 the	 story	 as	 if	 it	 were	 a	 harbinger	 of	 global	 doom.[<sup>9</sup>][9] Even	 the	 online	 version	 of	
Encyclopedia	Britannica	gave	credence	to the	story.	No	dead	trees	were	depicted	in	any	of	the	many	
articles	 I	 searched	 on	 the	 Internet.	My	 first	 rule	 of	 critical	 thinking	is	 never	 to	trust a	 report	 that	
begins	with	 the	words	“may”,	“might’	or	“could”.	 It	should	read,	“may	or	may	not”,	might	or	might	
not,	etc.

Many	 readers	 may	 or	 may	 not	 have	 stopped	 to	 think	 that	 it	 is	 perfectly	 natural	 for	 the	 oldest	
individuals	of	any	species	to	die	before	the	younger	ones eventually pass	away as	they too grow	old.	
It	might	 be	 worth	 worrying	if	 the	 youngest	baobab	 trees were	 dying	 at	 an	 unprecedented	 rate	if	
such	a	rate	could	be	established	with	credible	data. On	 the	other	hand	 the	natural	survival	rate	of	
the	young	of	many	species	is	very	low.

As	for	an	“unprecedented	rate” of	older	
trees	 dying,	 the	 only	 data provided in	
the	 source	 paper is	 from	 a	 Romanian	
chemistry	 professor	 who	 claims,
“Eight of	 the	 13	 oldest	 trees	 in	 Africa	
have	 died	 over	 the	 past	 decade.”<sup>10</sup>
Baobabs	 have	 a	 wide	 distribution	 in	
Africa,	across	the	sub-Saharan	belt	and	
down	 the	 east	 coast	 as	 far	 as	 South	
Africa.	 My	 research	 produced	 no	
estimate	of	the	total	number	of	Baobab	
trees	in	 Africa	 but	 one	 could	 hazard	 a	
guess	 that	 there	 are	 tens	 if	 not	
hundreds	 of	 thousands.	 Without	 a	
doubt	 it	 would	 not	 be	 unprecedented	
for	eight	of	 the	oldest	 trees to	die	in	a	
ten-year	 period.	 This is	 less than	 one	
tree	 per	 year. This	might	 or	might	 not	
be	 the	 silliest	 story	 to	 be	 taken	
seriously	 by	 the	 worldwide	 media	
lately.	Even	Fox	News	covered	it.

![GitHub Logo](/images/tree.jpg)

*Unlike	most	tropical	trees,	baobabs	are	deciduous.	Many	news	articles	
used	pictures	of	trees	with	no	leaves,	perhaps	implying	that	they	are	
dying.	No	photos	of	dead	baobabs	appeared	with	the	story.*

# GMOs will harm us and damage the environment.
A	cob	of	conventional	corn	looks	identical	to	a	cob	of	GM	corn.	The	GM	corn	may	actually	look	better	
because	it	was	better	protected	from	insect	damage due	to	the	modification	of	its	genes.	

The	 USFDA	 says	 they	 are	 “substantially	
equivalent”,	 in	 other	 words not	 different	
from	each	other	in	any	meaningful	way.	 Yet	
hundreds	 of	 activist	 groups	 insist	 there	 is	
something in	 the	 GM	 corn,	 obviously	
something	invisible,	 that	will	do	evil	 things	
to	the	planet	and	us.[<sup>11</sup>][11]

Monsanto,	 basically	 a	 seed	 and	 crop	
protection	company,	is	vilified	as	if	it	were	
producing	 weapons	 of	 mass	 destruction	
and	using	 them on	civilians.	Every	credible	
food,	 health,	 and	 science	 organization	 says	
GM	 food	 is	 perfectly	 safe[<sup>12</sup>][12] But	 the	
propaganda	 about	 an	 invisible	 poison	 is	
effective,	and	because	people can’t	 “see	 for	
themselves”	 they	 worry	 a	 lot about	
themselves	and	their	children.

![GitHub Logo](/images/corn.jpg)

*Because	there	is	zero	evidence	of	possible	harm	from	GM	foods,	antiGM	zealots	must	resort	to	scary	fake	images	to	drive	their	
campaigns.*

# Farmed salmon are full of poisons and they are destroying the wild salmon.

Of	course	the	“poisons”	are	invisible	and	the	salmon	
are	below	the	surface	of	the	sea	where	only	a	diver	
could	inspect	them.	The	anti-salmon	farm	activists	
contend	that	farmed	salmon	are	spreading	disease and	
sea-lice to	wild	salmon	stocks.[<sup>13</sup>][13] In	fact	the	farmed	
salmon	are	raised	in	land-based	hatcheries	and	are	
disease-free	and	lice-free	when	they	are	placed	into	
pens	in	the	sea.	It	is	the	wild	salmon	that	give	diseases	
and	lice	to	the	farmed	fish.	But	the	activists	get	away	
with	their	“story”	and	the	media	goes	along	because	it	
sells	papers	and	their readers	and	viewers can’t	go	
down	in	the	ocean	to	check	out	the	truth for	
themselves.	Farming	salmon	and	the	many	other	
species	raised	in	aquaculture	is	a	sustainable	
development.	It	takes	fishing	pressure	off	wild	stocks,	
many	of	which	are	seriously	depleted.	It	produces	one	
of	the	healthiest	sources	of	protein	and	contains	
beneficial	omega-3	oils.	And	aquaculture	provides	
employment	for	tens	of	millions	of	people	worldwide,	
often	in	remote	coastal	and	inland	communities.<sup>14</sup>

*Farmed	salmon	is	delicious,	nutritious,	available	fresh	
year-round	unlike	wild	salmon,	and	is	preferred	by	
chefs	for	its	consistency.	Wild	salmon	is	also	one	of	the	
most	nutritional	foods.*


# Nuclear energy is too dangerous and radiation will kill you[<sup>15</sup>][15]

Have	 you	 ever	 seen	 any	 nuclear	
radiation?	 No,	 because	 it	 is	 invisible	 –	
you	 need a	 Geiger	 counter	 to	 detect	 it,	
which	 most	 homes	 are	 not	 equipped	
with.	The	fact	is	in	terms	of	fatalities	per	
unit	 of	 energy	 produced;	 nuclear	is	 the	
safest	 technology	of	 them	all.	There	has	
been	 only	 one	 nuclear	 accident	 that	
caused	 death	 to	 civilians,	 Chernobyl,	
and	 according	 to	 the	 World	 Health	
Organization	 it	 was	 responsible	 for	 56	
deaths.[<sup>16</sup>][16] More	than	that	were	killed	in	a	
single	 hydroelectric	 dam	 accident	 in	
Russia	 in 2009.[<sup>17</sup>][17] In	 the	 Fukushima	
incident	 in	 2011	 no	 one	 died	 from	
radiation	 and	 according	 the	 Radiation	
Effects	 Research	 Foundation	 in	
Hiroshima, there will be no discernable	
health	effects	in	the	future.[<sup>18</sup>][18] Yet	activist	groups	have	so	scared	the	public	with	this	invisible	“threat”
that Germany has decided to shut all its nuclear plants and many countries have decided not to	
build	any	more.	Meanwhile	China,	India,	and	Russia	have	surpassed	the	West	in	nuclear	technology	
and are building scores of new nuclear plants because they know it is the future of electricity	
production.	

![GitHub Logo](/images/nuclear.jpg)

*South	Korea	produces	nearly	30	percent	of	its	electricity	with	nuclear	
reactors.	It	is	the	safest	of	all	electricity	technologies	measured	by	
fatalities	per	unit	of	energy	produced.*

# There is a “sea of plastic” twice the size of Texas in the North Pacific Gyre north of Hawaii

First	question:	have	you	ever	seen	an	aerial
or	 satellite	 photograph	 of	 the	 “sea	 of	
plastic”?	 Probably	 not,	 because	 it	 doesn’t	
really exist.	 But	 it	 makes	 a	 good	 wordpicture	 and	 after	 all	 plastic	is	 full	 of	 deadly	
poisons	 and	 is	 killing	 seabirds	 and	 marine	
mammals	by	the	thousands.	This	is	also	fake	
news and	 gives	 rise	 to	 calls	 for	 bans	 on	
plastic	 and other	 drastic	 measures.	 Silly	
people	are	 banning	plastic	 straws	as	if	 they	
were a	 dire	threat	 to	 the	 environment.	The	
fact	is	a	piece	of	plastic	floating	in	the	ocean is	no	more	toxic	than	a	piece	of	wood.	Wood has	been	entering the	sea	in	vast	quantities	for	millions	
of	years.	And	in	the	same	way	that	floating	woody	debris provides	habitat	for	barnacles,	seaweeds,	
crabs,	and	many	other	species	of	marine	life,	so	does	 floating	plastic.	That’s	why	seabirds and	 fish
eat the	bits	of	plastic,	to	get	the	food	that	is	growing	on	them.	While	it	is	true	that	some	individual	
birds	 and	 animals	 are	 harmed	 by	 plastic	 debris,	 discarded	 fishnets	 in	 particular,	 this	 is	 far	
outweighed	by	the	additional	food	supply	it	provides. Plastic	is	not	poison	or	pollution,	it	is	litter.

*Photos	like	this	are	so	obviously	faked	because	nearly	all	these	
plastic	objects	could	have	been	passed	through	an	albatross’s	
digestive	tract.*

# “There are a possible 3,000,000 undersea volcanoes doing something unobserved.”

This	is	 a	 direct	 quote	 from	 a	 Science	
Daily	 article	 on	 February	 15,	 2015.[<sup>19</sup>][19]
The	 article	 refers	 to	 “a	 new	 study”	
attributed	 to	 the	 Earth	 Institute	 at	
Columbia	University,	which	speculates	
that	 millions	 of	 undersea	 volcanoes	
are	 spewing	 millions	 of	 tons	 of	 CO2	
into	the	ocean.	No	mention	is	made	of	
the	 fact	that	the	US	Geological	Service	
estimates	 that	 volcanic	 activity	
produces	less	 than	one	percent	of	 the	
CO2 emissions	 produced	 from	 human	
use	 of	 fossil fuels,[<sup>20</sup>][20] or	 that	 there	 is	
really	 no	 direct	 evidence	 that	 CO2	
causes	 global	 warming	 as	 claimed	 by	
so	many	activist	scientists,	media and	
politicians.	 The	 only	 proven	 effect	 of	
CO2 is	 to	increase	 the	growth	of	 trees	
and	food	crops	and	to	make	plants	more efficient	with	water.	This	has	resulted	in	a	“greening	of	the	
Earth”	and	the	spread	of	trees	into	areas	that	were	previously	too	dry	for	them.	For	a	discussion	on	
the	important	role	of	CO2 as	the	basis	of	all	life	on	Earth	you	can	download my	paper	on	the subject
here.[<sup>21</sup>][21]

# Ocean “Acidification” will kill all the coral reefs and shellfish in the world

Once	 again,	invisible	 CO2 will	wreck	 havoc	 by	 so	 drastically	lowering	 the	 pH	 of	 the	 oceans	it	will	
make it	impossible	 for the	out-of-sight corals	and	shellfish	to	produce	their	calcareous	shells,	thus	
undermining	 the	 entire	 food	 chain	in	 the	 sea	 and	 destroying	 fisheries worldwide.	 This	 story	 was	
invented	around	2004;	co-incident	with	the	beginning	of	the	20-year	“pause”	in	global	warming	that	
began	around	1998. The	fact	is	coral	reefs	evolved	when	CO2 was	at	least	10	times	higher	than	today	
and	corals	have	survived	and	 thrived	 for	hundreds	of	millions	of	 years	since	 then.	It	is	also	a fact	that	the	Humboldt	Current	off	Peru,	which	has the	highest	CO2 and	lowest	pH	in	the	world’s	oceans,	
produces	20	percent of	the	world’s	fish	catch.	In	other	words	more	CO2 is	good	for	growth	in	the	sea	
in	the	same	way	it	is	on	land.	It	doesn’t	take	much	research	to	conclude	that	ocean	“acidification”	is	
one	big	fabrication.	For	an in-depth	discussion	my	paper	on	the	subject	can	be	downloaded here.[<sup>22</sup>][22]

# “Climate Change is Killing the Cedars of Lebanon”

A July 18, 2018 article in The New York Times reports that rising temperatures are driving the	
Cedars	of	Lebanon	to	extinction.[<sup>23</sup>][23] All	the	numerous	photos	in	the	article	are	of	healthy	living	trees	
with the exception of one lonely sawed-off stump that is claimed to have died from an insect	
infestation. In flowery language the anguish of impending doom is expressed with appropriate	
references	to	Jesus	and	God.	In	fact the	range	of	the	Cedars	of	Lebanon	has	been	drastically	reduced	
over the centuries by cutting the trees for timber and converting the land to other uses - a classic	
case of deforestation as opposed to reforestation. Grazing land for goats, sheep and cattle have	
replaced the forests over wide areas and the grazers ensure that no new trees can establish	
themselves. Most of the remaining cedars are in protected reserves where there is no evidence of	
impending extinction or mass die-off. A careful reader will detect that all the dire predictions are	
just	that;	unsupported	speculation	into	the	future.	Very	few	people	have	the	ability	to	go	to	Lebanon	
and make a thorough investigation into the state of the cedar forests. No doubt if a knowledgeable	


person	reported	that	the	existing	trees	were	in	a	state	of	good	health	the	New	York	Times	would	not	
print	it.	

![GitHub Logo](/images/stump.jpg)

*This	lonely	stump	is	the	only	dead	Cedar	of	Lebanon	shown	in	
the	many	photographs	in	The	New	York	Times	article.	There	is	
no	suggestion	that	it	died	from	climate	change,	rather	an	
insect	infestation	is	blamed.*

![GitHub Logo](/images/grazing.jpg)

*The	deforestation	of	native	forests	and	their	conversion	to	
grazing	lands	is	a	major	cause	of	forest	loss	around	the	world.	
This	has	nothing	to	do	with	climate	change.*

# Conclusion
Is it just a coincidence that 12 of the most publicized alleged environmental catastrophes and	
threats	of	doom happen	to	be	invisible	or	very remote,	or	both?	Or	is	it	just	so	much	easier	to	create	
a fake “narrative” when the public can’t check it out for themselves? I will leave that judgement to	
the	reader.
